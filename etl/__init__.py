"""
ETL package for Assignment 1.

This package provides three main steps:
- extract: read raw data from CSV, Excel, and API
- transform: clean and reshape data into star-schema tables
- load: write the transformed tables into PostgreSQL

Notebooks in this project can import from this package instead of
re-implementing the logic in each notebook.
